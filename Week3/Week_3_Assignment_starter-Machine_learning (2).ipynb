    "Use our saved churn data from week 2 with machine learning to predict if customers will churn or not, similar to what we did in the FTE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- break up data into features and targets\n",
    "- split data into train and test sets\n",
    "- use at least one ML model to fit to the training data\n",
    "- evaluate performance on the train and test sets: at least evaluate accuracy and compare it with the \"no information rate\"\n",
    "- plot a confusion matrix\n",
    "- write something describing how the ML algorithm could be used in a business setting\n",
    "- Write a short summary of what you did with the overall process - describe any important EDA findings, data cleaning and preparation, modeling, and evaluation in your summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Optional*: For an addition challenge, try the following:\n",
    "- fit more ML models and compare their scores\n",
    "- optimize the hyperparameters of your models\n",
    "- examine more metrics such as the classification report and ROC/AUC\n",
    "- plot the distribution of the probability predictions (from the `predict_proba()` function from our model) for each class (1s and 0s)"

Should there be a system where a report gets sent to someone in customer retention or marketing with at-risk customers? We should really think about these things in the first step, although we can consider them here this time."
