    "- Check for outliers in numeric data, and deal with them if needed\n",
    "- Check for missing values, and decide how to deal with them if needed\n",
    "- Convert categorical columns to numeric values\n",
    "- Create at least one new feature by combining multiple columns. For example, you could calculate the ratio of total charges to tenure. Create at least one plot for your new feature.\n",
    "- Save the data to a csv (or another filetype of your choice) for use next week.\n",
    "- Write a short analysis at the end of the notebook describing your findings and what you did.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do more data cleaning, preparation, and EDA beyond these basic requirements if you want to learn more and develop your data science skills. For example, you could use a box-cox transformation on the numeric data or try other outlier methods."
