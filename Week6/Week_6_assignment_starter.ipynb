    "- How many movies has this user watched?\n",
    "- Plot a bar chart of their movie ratings. The bar chart should be the counts of the number of unique ratings.\n",
    "    - Hint: the `sort_index()` function from pandas might be helpful to make the bar plot look nicer.\n",
    "- What are some of user 2's top movies?\n",
    "    - Hint: to get the actual movie titles, you can use pandas [merge](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) function, although using the movie IDs is OK too.\n",
    "- Find the most similar user in the movielens dataset to user 2 using at least 2 distance metrics. Be sure to use cosine distance as one of your choices.\n",
    "- Recommend a few movies for user 2 using similarity metrics.\n",
    "- Do the recommendations from this method make sense?\n",
    "- Write a short analysis of the results, and justify which similarity metric(s) you used.\n",

    "Optional challenges:\n",
    "- Perform other analyses (e.g. EDA, visualizations) of the movies watched from this dataset, or from a bigger part of the dataset for the movielens dataset: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/\n",
    "- Add yourself as a user in the data with ratings for movies you've watched, and find recommendations for next movies to watch. \n",
    "- Use a more advanced collaborative or content-based recommender to make recommendations (e.g. using the surprise package in Python)\n",
    "    - Try making predictions for user 2. How do they compare with our basic model?\n",
    "    - Add your own movie ratings, or use another recommender dataset and add your own preferences, then get recommendations for yourself"
