    "Use the `churn_data.csv` file to carry out a similar EDA and visualization process as what we did in the FTE. Create at least 2 EDA plots, and create a HTML file with an auto-EDA analysis using pandas-profiling or another auto-EDA Python package. Write a short analysis at the end of the assignment in markdown. \n",

    "This is customer churn data for a telecommunications company. Customers can have phone as well as other services. The company is looking to reduce customer churn, where customers stop using the company's services and cancel their account. The 'Churn' column has a binary target, yes or no, that denotes if a customer churned. We want to create a machine learning model to predict the Churn target using the other available data in the dataset. Ideally, we will deploy this model to integrate with the company's database, so that a churn risk column is created for each customer. This will enable customer service reps and others to devise and use strategies to reduce churn.\n",

    "Carry out some EDA as we did in the FTE, such as using pandas-profiling. Create a histogram like we did in the FTE, where we plot a numeric column with the target as the 'hue'. Optional challenge: create other plots with the target as the hue, such as bar plots for the categorical columns."
